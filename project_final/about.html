      <h4 class="abouth4">Our Philosophy</h4>
      <p class="aboutp"> Individualized drug treatment can best meet the needs of the patients and help them advance through the stages of change toward addiction recovery.  Effective drug addiction treatment depends on careful assessment and treatment of each patient’s physical, psychological, and social needs; working with the patient “where they are at.”  Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease, and should be treated as such in a medical and psycho-social manner.  Comprehensive, affordable treatment has the best chance to be effective in the resolution of chronic substance abuse problems.  Family or support network involvement is crucial for long-term success.  Every employee at BAART Programs understands the necessary factors involved in successfully overcoming an addiction, and we are here to help educate our patients, and provide the informational and  medical resources that they need.  Since our beginnings in San Francisco, we expanded throughout the Bay Area to Oakland, Richmond and Antioch, bringing hope to patients, and eventually extended our reach across the country.  If you are struggling with addiction to opiates like Methadone or Oxycontin, alcohol addiction, or any other substance dependency, contact BAART Programs today to talk to our specialists about creating an individual and effective drug rehabilitation program for you.</p>
